# Richlists
A repository for managing network and token richlists across the interchain. Data stored in this repository is used to build network and tokens richlists at https://analytics.smartstake.io


Features supported are:
 - Listing of IBC denoms on external networks for the token or network 
 - Listing of known addresses (exchanges/LPs/SC) - this will result in labeling the address as such. It will also allow better understanding of Supply Distribution charts. This is meant to be used only for non-individual addresses

The listing of any tokens on smart stake is not an endorsement for the token. This is currently a free service for all the tokens. If you like to support Smart Stake, consider staking with Smart Stake and/or encouraging your communities to stake with Smart Stake.

- Follow instructions for managing networks at [Networks](networks/README.md) page.
- Follow instructions for managing tokens at [Tokens](tokens/README.md) page.
